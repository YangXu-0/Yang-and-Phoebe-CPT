# Yang and Phoebe Grade 11 CS Cumulative Project
This is our grade 11 computer science project. We decided to try to program a mini version of the very popular game "Undertale" in Python.

## Features
- Similar openworld 2-D movement outside of combat (no animations unfortunately)
- Enemy encounters as the game progresses (mini version of the actual game so instead of the original random encounter system, we programmed a system of essentially mini bosses progressing to a final boss)
- Combat very similar to Undertale, complete with the fight option, items, talking, running, health (of both player and enemy), and fight mechanism during enemy attacks (varied for each enemy)

A little rough around the edges but the fundamental features are all present.
